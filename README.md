#### Yet another tetris cli in rust...

## Why? 🤔

Don't know 🤷‍♂️ I've done 0 programming project of this summer, wanted to do something,
somebody spoke to me about a todo cli in rust and 1ns later was like "yes it's clear now, the reason of my birth is surely to do yet another tetris cli game in rust" 😩

## Purpose

1. **None**
2. Seriously **idk**
3.
4. Maybe learning [ANSI escape code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code)
5. Mainly because I love rust 🦀✨
6. Easter 🥚: I speedrunned this, I think I have the any% WR now (If I forgot to add the time, I'm dumb)
